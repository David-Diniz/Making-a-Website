        this is a paragraph, if my theory is correct, this text will appear on screen of my website in an unkown format, thats weird considering this isn't a string
        is this still part of the same paragraph?
        does
        putting
        things 
        on 
        a new line
        put them on
        a new
        line? who knows?<br>
